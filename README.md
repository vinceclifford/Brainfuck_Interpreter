# Brainfuck_Interpreter

This C-Programm will interpret Brainfuck-Code. It's highly optimized for minimizing the amount of proccesor cycles needed to interpret the code. In a competition with more than 850 submissions, my interpreter was the 5th fastest.


In order to run the interpreter the projrct has to be cloned with the command 
```
git clone
```
