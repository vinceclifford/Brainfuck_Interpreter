# Brainfuck_Interpreter

This C-Programm will interpret Brainfuck-Code. It's highly optimized for minimizing the amount of proccesor cycles needed to interpret the code. In a competition with more than 850 submissions, my interpreter was the 5th fastest.


In order to run the interpreter the project has to be cloned
```
git clone https://github.com/vinceclifford/Brainfuck_Interpreter.git
```

I willingly decided to implement all the code in one single C-file to make the compilation as easy as possible. Compile the program with gcc or clang. Run the command to compile

````
gcc main.c
````
